<h1>Improvise Freestyle</h1>



# Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this project is to create a simplified process of musical improvisation and composition, as well as musical education and related fields of entertainment. 

Inspiration came from the expensiveness and uneasiness we felt for current musical tools. 

Players of this program could experiment ideas by typing. Only the effective key which could be mapped to a certain instruction is kept in the sequence that converts to wave file of track. Tracks could be added to create multi-tracks result.

Potential users could be anyone, ex. kid/adult/student/educator/musician/gamer who would like to experiment with music. 

For musicians, musical ideas could be written as text of sentences, which map to instructions of writing notes.  Although current version only includes 3 samples for a track, it could be easily expanded. (ex. to all 12 semi-tones of an instrument) Please do not expect this project to replace other tools such as DAW, it's only for the purpose of simplified experiment.

# Features

## Text to Music

Transform your keyboard into a music instrument, it could be a simplified simulation of any instrument if samples provided, or a imaginary instrument of map from key to sample, listen to your ideas just by typing text.

## Check the Sequence of Instructions after Input

Each sentence comes with feedback of the instructions you created, try-and-error could be enjoyable process of refinement.

## Stylize with Your Choice of Samples

Substitute sample files and create your own library of instruments.

## Simple Key Scheme

Start with 3 samples (key 's','d','f') per track,
adjusting duration of note(key 'y','u','i','o','p' for 1,1/2,1/4,1/8,1/16 beat, key 'h','j','k' for 1/3,1/6,1/12 beat),
rest with key '-',
That's all!
Other key doesn't make change to the instructions. For readabilty, for example, we could use space to make words of sentence clear.

# User Interaction

## Choose from Menu

User navigates by menu to the option interested.

## Compose with Text at will

In the 'Improvise' session, type freely until Exit-Key '1' included. No key is wrong, only effective keys to be mapped to instructions are
interpretted.

# System Requirements

* This version is designed for MacOS system, using afplay media-player to play wave files.
* Writen in Ruby 2.7.0, using gems wavefile, colorize, tty-font, tty-prompt and their dependency.
